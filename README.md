To run program,input.txt file must be passed as input.

To solve bipartite matching problem as a network flow:

1. Sink and target node are required

2. Path cost from sink to objects must be one

3. Path cost from object to robot might change depending on attributes of object but in this particular problem objects are identical which is one.

4. Path cost from robots to target node depends on robotsâ€™ carry capacity


In this assignment, each
object should be assigned to a single robot. However, a robot may be assigned to more than one
object. You are given an input file named input.txt. It includes the number of objects and robots on
the first line followed by the list L. The last line includes the list P which describes the maximum
number of objects to be carried by a specific robot.
